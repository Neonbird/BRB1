GO_REGULATION_OF_FIBRINOLYSIS	14	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of fibrinolysis, an ongoing process that solubilizes fibrin, resulting in the removal of small blood clots. [GOC:ai]	2	0.1429	5.65E-6	2.13E-2
GO_BLOOD_COAGULATION_INTRINSIC_PATHWAY	18	A protein activation cascade that contributes to blood coagulation and consists of the interactions among high molecular weight kininogen, prekallikrein, and factor XII that lead to the activation of clotting factor X.

GO_PLASMINOGEN_ACTIVATION	24	The process in which inactive plasminogen is processed to active plasmin. This process includes cleavage at an internal Arg-Val site to form an N-terminal A-chain and C-terminal B-chain held together by a disulfide bond, and can include further proteolytic cleavage events to remove the preactivation peptide. [PMID:9548733]	2	0.0833	1.71E-5	4.29E-2
GO_FIBRINOLYSIS	28	A process that solubilizes fibrin in the bloodstream of a multicellular organism, chiefly by the proteolytic action of plasmin. [GOC:jl, PMID:15842654]	2	0.0714	2.34E-5	4.81E-2
GO_PROTEIN_ACTIVATION_CASCADE	28	A response to a stimulus that consists of a sequential series of modifications to a set of proteins where the product of one reaction acts catalytically in the following reaction. The magnitude of the response is typically amplified at each successive step in the cascade. Modifications typically include proteolysis or covalent modification, and may also include binding events.
